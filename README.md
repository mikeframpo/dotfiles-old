vimconfig

My vim configuration files.

If you are new to Vim I do not recommend cloning this repository or any other vim configuration!

Vim is a highly configurable text editor, it is up to you to define your own work flow using the tools Vim provides. Define your own mappings, define your own plugins. Any pre-configured vim-based IDEs will likely confuse the new user more than anything else.
